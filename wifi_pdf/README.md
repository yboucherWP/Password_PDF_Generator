# WiFi PDF Generator

This package generates one tenant WiFi PDF per record plus one merged PDF for the full batch. It uses direct PDF drawing with ReportLab as the final recommendation because it gives the most deterministic layout control, the least deployment complexity on a VM, and the cleanest path for long-term maintenance.

## Final Recommendation

Use direct PDF drawing with ReportLab.

- HTML/CSS to PDF is more fragile for fixed print layouts and adds browser/rendering drift.
- DOCX to PDF is the worst fit for server automation and precise QR placement.
- ReportLab is the best mix of fixed layout control, batch reliability, and simple Linux VM deployment.

## Architecture

Recommended production flow:

`Zoho webhook -> Caddy/Nginx -> FastAPI -> Pydantic validation -> QR generator -> ReportLab renderer -> individual PDFs + TXT export + ZIP export -> merged PDF -> optional Zoho WorkDrive upload -> optional local cleanup`

Why this is the best architecture:

- deterministic rendering for a fixed bilingual tenant handout
- strong request validation before any file generation
- easy separation of template, config, inputs, outputs, and external upload logic
- simple single-VM deployment that can later sit behind a queue if volume grows
- webhook requests can be acknowledged immediately while PDF generation continues in the background

## Libraries

- `fastapi`: webhook endpoint and health endpoint
- `pydantic`: production-grade JSON validation and schema export
- `reportlab`: direct PDF drawing with exact text and QR placement
- `qrcode[pil]`: QR PNG generation
- `pypdf`: merge ordered individual PDFs into one combined file
- `httpx`: Zoho WorkDrive OAuth refresh and file upload
- `logging`: rotating local logs without adding another dependency

## Recommended JSON Schema

Canonical request shape:

```json
{
  "building_name": "101-103 Rue Yanick",
  "workdrive_folder_id": "optional-workdrive-folder-id",
  "template_name": "basic_template",
  "records": [
    {
      "ssid": "app101_jw",
      "password": "4430jw6355$@",
      "auth_type": "WPA",
      "hidden": false,
      "tenant_name": "Tenant 101",
      "unit_label": "Appartement 101"
    }
  ]
}
```

Compatibility note:

- the code also accepts a raw JSON array of records for backward compatibility
- the recommended production schema is the top-level object above because it carries building metadata and the per-batch WorkDrive folder id
- `template_name` accepts `basic_template` or `qr_code_template`; `basic_template` is the default when the field is omitted
- the API also accepts a thin CRM-style payload and normalizes it server-side

Thin CRM-style payload accepted by the VM:

```json
{
  "Deal_Name": "101-103 Rue Yanick",
  "Ville_de_l_immeuble": "Montreal",
  "record_id": "4143382000147783039",
  "Workdrive_folder": "https://workdrive.zoho.com/folder/abc123folderid",
  "Type_de_MDP": "Standard",
  "Predfined": "true",
  "ssid_list": "app101_jw,app102_jw,app103_jw,app104_jw",
  "Mots_de_passes": "pass101$!,pass102@!",
  "Mots_de_passes_2": "pass103$@,pass104@!"
}
```

Server-side normalization rules:

- `Deal_Name` is accepted as `building_name`
- `Ville_de_l_immeuble` or `City` is accepted as `city`
- `record_id` / `Fiche_Id` is accepted as the Zoho CRM record id for post-generation updates
- `Workdrive_folder` can be a full URL or a raw folder id
- `QR Code Only` accepts a boolean flag; when it is true, the batch uses the QR Code Template and creates/uploads individual PDFs, the merged PDF, and one QR ZIP
- `Type_de_MDP` controls the password mode; when it is `PPSK`, the app uses `PPSK_SSID` as the SSID for every PDF
- `Predfined` / `Predefined` controls whether supplied values are used as-is or generated on the VM
- `Unit_s`, `Mots_de_passes`, `Mots_de_passes_2`, `ssid_list`, and similar fields can be arrays, CSV strings, semicolon-separated strings, or newline-separated strings
- password list parts are concatenated in order, so `Mots_de_passes` and `Mots_de_passes_2` behave like one combined password list
- if `Type_de_MDP` is `PPSK`, supplied passwords are mandatory and the VM will not generate passwords even if `Predfined` is accidentally sent as `false`
- if `Predfined` is `true`, incoming SSIDs, units, and passwords are preserved; no prefix, suffix, or generated password is applied
- if `Predfined` is `false`, the VM ignores incoming password fields and generates passwords in the format `####xx####$$`
- if passwords are generated, a CRM record id is provided, and no existing password values were sent, the VM updates the `Fiches_Techniques` record:
  - `Mots_de_passes` gets up to the first 150 generated passwords
  - `MDP` gets any remaining generated passwords
- if `Predfined` is `false` but existing password values are still sent by mistake, the VM generates the PDF batch but skips the CRM password field update to avoid overwriting those existing values
- if `Predfined` is not `true` and `ssid_list` contains numeric unit identifiers like `101,102`, the server generates SSIDs as `<prefix><unit>_<two-random-letters>`
- if `Predfined` is not `true` and `ssid_list` is not sent, the server builds SSIDs from `SSID_Prefix + Unit_s + "_" + <two-random-letters>`
- if no prefix key is sent at all, the default prefix is `app`
- if `SSID_Prefix` is explicitly `Empty`, `null`, or blank, the VM uses no prefix at all and does not append `_<two-random-letters>`
- if `Type_de_MDP` is `PPSK`, the payload must include `PPSK_SSID`; every PDF uses that same SSID while keeping one password/unit row per record
- if `Type_de_MDP` is `PPSK`, the TXT and `.ya` exports use the original `Unit_s` values instead of repeating the shared `PPSK_SSID`
- malformed counts or unparseable WorkDrive links are rejected with validation errors before rendering

The exported JSON schema file is generated by:

```bash
python -m wifi_pdf.schema_export
```

## QR Code Rules

WiFi QR payload format:

```text
WIFI:T:<auth>;S:<ssid>;P:<password>;H:true;;
```

Rules:

- `T` should be `WPA`, `WEP`, or `nopass`
- `P` is omitted for open networks
- `H:true` is included only for hidden SSIDs
- special characters in SSID and password must escape `\`, `;`, `,`, `:`, and `"`

Example:

```text
WIFI:T:WPA;S:app101_jw;P:4430jw6355$@;;
```

## Workflow

1. Receive JSON from CLI or the webhook endpoint.
2. Validate it with Pydantic before any file writes happen.
3. Create a timestamped batch directory with `qr`, `individual`, and `merged` subfolders.
4. Generate one QR image per WiFi record.
5. Render one PDF per record using the reusable ReportLab template.
6. Generate a tab-separated TXT export named `Mot de passe <building_name>.txt`, unless `QR Code Only` is true.
7. Generate a `.ya` export, unless `QR Code Only` is true, with:
   - line 1: `Deal_Name - City`
   - line 2: final SSIDs separated by commas, or raw units for PPSK batches
   - line 3: final passwords separated by commas
   - line 4: `10,20,30...` for the number of SSIDs
8. Merge the PDFs in input order.
9. Generate a ZIP export containing all individual PDFs plus the merged PDF. Standard batches use `Mot de passe <building_name>.zip`; QR-only batches use `<building_name>_QR.zip`.
10. Write a manifest without storing passwords.
11. Return an accepted job id immediately so webhook callers do not wait for long-running uploads.
12. Process the batch in the background.
13. If WorkDrive is enabled, upload the merged PDF, TXT export, `.ya` export, ZIP export, and/or individual PDFs; `QR Code Only` batches upload individual PDFs, the merged PDF, and the QR ZIP into a `QR Codes` folder under `Document locataire`.
14. Delete the local batch folder after a successful run so local PDFs, TXT files, ZIPs, and manifests do not remain on disk.

## Error Handling Strategy

- reject invalid JSON with HTTP 422 or CLI failure before rendering begins
- reject missing OAuth and WorkDrive folder configuration before upload begins
- never log passwords
- clean up local output files after successful processing; failed runs still keep files for diagnosis
- raise hard failures on render or merge errors instead of silently skipping records
- store a manifest without secrets for traceability

## Production Best Practices

- run on Ubuntu Server behind Caddy or Nginx with TLS
- protect the webhook with `X-API-Key`
- use environment variables or an env file for Zoho secrets
- keep custom Unicode fonts in `assets/fonts/` for broader password character coverage
- use a static LAN IP or DHCP reservation for the VM
- do not expose ESXi management or the Python port directly to the internet
- use nightly VM backups; snapshots are not backups

## Final Implementation Path

Use the current ReportLab-based package exactly as the production runtime.

- Host it on a LAN Ubuntu VM on ESXi.
- Forward public HTTPS traffic to the VM through your router and reverse proxy.
- Send Zoho webhooks to `/webhooks/zoho/wifi-pdfs`.
- Keep Codex as a maintenance tool on the VM, not as the runtime that answers webhooks.

## Secrets And WorkDrive

Environment variables:

```text
WIFI_PDF_API_KEY=replace-with-long-random-secret
ZOHO_WORKDRIVE_CLIENT_ID=...
ZOHO_WORKDRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
ZOHO_WORKDRIVE_REFRESH_TOKEN=...
ZOHO_WORKDRIVE_ACCESS_TOKEN=optional-short-lived-token
ZOHO_WORKDRIVE_PARENT_FOLDER_ID=optional-default-folder-id
```

Folder id resolution order:

1. `workdrive_folder_id` from the webhook JSON
2. `ZOHO_WORKDRIVE_PARENT_FOLDER_ID` from the VM
3. `workdrive.parent_folder_id` from config

Upload behavior:

- the app treats the provided WorkDrive folder id as the parent building folder
- it searches inside that folder for a child folder named `Document locataire`
- uploads go into that child folder
- uploads include the merged PDF, the individual PDFs, the TXT export, the `.ya` export, and the ZIP export by default
- QR-only uploads go into a `QR Codes` child folder under `Document locataire`; the folder is created if it does not exist
- uploads overwrite same-name files in that child folder by default
- if `Document locataire` is missing, the batch fails with a clear WorkDrive error instead of uploading to the wrong place

## Usage

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Generate from the CLI:

```bash
python -m wifi_pdf.cli --input input/wifi_pdf/example_records.json --print-json
```

Generate from a thin CRM-style payload:

```bash
python -m wifi_pdf.cli --input input/wifi_pdf/example_crm_payload.json --print-json
```

Export the schema:

```bash
python -m wifi_pdf.schema_export
```

Run the API locally:

```bash
uvicorn wifi_pdf.api:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Health check:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

Webhook test:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/webhooks/zoho/wifi-pdfs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: replace-with-long-random-secret" \
  --data @input/wifi_pdf/example_records.json
```

The webhook returns quickly with an accepted job payload like:

```json
{
  "status": "accepted",
  "job_id": "20260323-123456-123456-101-103-Rue-Yanick",
  "job_status_url": "/jobs/20260323-123456-123456-101-103-Rue-Yanick"
}
```

Check job status:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/jobs/<job_id>
```
